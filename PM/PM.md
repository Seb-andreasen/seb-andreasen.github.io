## Thoughts on Product Management

The number one priority is to Keep the customer at the center of your decision-making process. Understand their needs, pain points, and behaviors to create a product that solves their problems. Well, sure, but how to operationalise this?

The real struggle is to identify the white spaces in the market and close the gab with your product. This is not easy and requires iterations.

The most important task for the PM is to tell the story of what the market wants to the rest of the team. i.e. maintain the holistic overview while also being able to dive into the technical discussions and challenge engineers, designers, management, etc. 

and how to do this? 

- By being data-driven. Use analytics and user feedback to make informed decisions and measure the impact of your product changes. Be scientific, construct hypotheses and test them.

- Continuously iterate and experiment. A successful product requires ongoing testing and learning to optimize user experience and drive growth. The real job for the PM starts after the first product launch.

- Prioritize ruthlessly. There will always be more ideas than resources, so it's important to focus on the highest-impact features that align with business objectives.
