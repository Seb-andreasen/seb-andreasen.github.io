## Climate change

**Project description:** 
In my opinion the most impressive thing you can do with data is tell a story without words.
A great example of this is the [warming stripes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warming_stripes) made by [Ed Hawkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Hawkins_(climatologist)). 

I was curious about the data and wanted to investigate it myself.  

### 1. Data source

The data stems from [Met Office Hadley Centre observations datasets](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcrut5/data/current/download.html). The data contains estimates of monthly temperature anomalies since the beginning of 1850 relative to 1960-1990 level. 

### 2. The analysis

The waming stripes shows us the average temperature anomaly pr year. However, I was curious about the distribution pr year, as the distribution usually tells us a lot more than the average. In this case I have plotted the distribution pr year and conducted an ANOVA test. The test concluded that the distributions have changed significantly over time, which is also backed by the visualisation.

### 3. Future work

The visualization provides a clear illustration of how temperatures have changed over time, which is cause for concern. Solving the problem of climate change is undeniably challenging, but I remain optimistic that we can find solutions.
